  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Anshu Singh</strong>, a B.Tech CSE student at
    <strong>IILM University, Greater Noida</strong>, with a strong passion for
    web development and UI/UX design.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently focused on mastering <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>,
    while also exploring how thoughtful UI/UX design can turn simple websites
    into meaningful user experiences. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and
    user-friendly interfaces that not only look good but feel intuitive to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a learner, I believe in growing step by step — from understanding core
    web fundamentals to moving towards advanced frontend technologies and
    modern design systems. I’m constantly experimenting, learning, and
    improving through hands-on projects and real-world inspired designs.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the future, my goal is to become a skilled frontend developer and UI/UX
    designer, capable of designing and developing complete digital products
    from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not coding or designing, I enjoy sports and creative work, which
    helps me stay disciplined, focused, and inspired.
